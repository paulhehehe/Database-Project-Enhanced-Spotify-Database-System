# Database-Project-Enhanced-Spotify-Database-System
Our application manages an individual's Spotify streaming data, including user playlists, tracks listened to, a dedicated section for 1980's classic tracks, top 10 ranking songs, and artist information. The design of the database incorporates various relationships, such as hierarchies (from user to playlists to tracks), is-a (a track is an output of an artist), contains (a playlist contains multiple songs), and related-to (an artist is related to various tracks, and a track can be related to many playlists).
The Access front-end provides users with a smooth experience to manage and navigate their streaming data. Various forms and reports facilitate adding, editing, and viewing data, tracking historic change of data which making the application user-friendly and intuitive, even when handling complex relationships within the data.
